#Game Rules

	- Pentris is a variation of Tetris. Instead of having tetriminoes comprised of 4 orthogonal squares, it has pentaminoes comprised of 5 squares.
	
	- The game will generate a block and the block will fall. Control the block as it falls and try to make a line by filling every square in a row. If you make a line, the line will disappear, making more room for falling blocks. If you manage to make 10 lines, the fall speed will speed up 
	
# Controls
	- A: move a falling block left
	- D: move a falling block right 
	- S: block will fall faster. Let go and it will go back to normal speed
	- W: Hold a block for later. If you have a block already being held, it will become your new falling block. 
	- Q: Rotate block 90 degrees counter-clockwise
	- E: Rotate block 90 degrees clockwise 
	- Space: Quick drop. Block will immediately fall as far as it can and game will generate a new block. 

# Scenes

## Root Scene
	-  
## Pentamino 1-18
	- Each of the 18 pentaminos have their own scene, which I used to set up the collision and 

# Media

## Art 

	- I made the block textures myself. It's just 3 squares nested within each other. I then used a blur tool over the blocks. 
	- Background is just a black screen which has had a grid patter superimposed on it by a website that I found online
	- Holding cell is just a rectangle with transparent inside. 

## Sounds
	
	- Found the sounds from Kenney's Impact sound package.
